**Description**
This is a spellchecker using Java. It takes a user provided dictionary and then takes user input and determines of the word is spelled correctly. It can detect the following problems: missing letters, swapped letters, extra letters, wrong letters, and phonetic substitution. It uses a hashmap for efficiency purposes and the chaining method to deal with collisions.  

How to start the program:
Double click on the Spellcheck.jar file or right click and select open

How to use the program:
Enter a single word to see if you spelled it correctly. Do not enter an entire sentence as the program is not built for that. It can only handle single words currently.

How to quit from the program:
You can either click on cancel on the dialog box or type 'quit' into the dialog box for the program to quit. The spelling for 'quit' has been provided for you, so you shouldn't need to enter it to see its spelling.

Warning:
Ensure that the wordlist.txt file is in the same folder as the executable jar file "Spellcheck.jar" The program will not work without a dictionary. 

Tip:
If you would like to substitute your own word list, simply name a text file wordlist and ensure it is in the same folder as the jar file.
